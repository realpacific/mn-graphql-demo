While I would love to chime in on which web framework is the best my observation is that:<p>a) the information I gain from reading a poll is minimal<p>b) the comments to a poll are less interesting than an ask YC link or a link to a story. The reason being that polls are (mostly) yes/no answers and tend to promote yes/no answers or flamewars.<p>Just my opinion of course.

I like the overview of the different votes at the top of the thread that the polling feature provides but I think there should only be 2 ways of voting:<p>1. vote only when you add a comment by specifying your vote in addition to the comment<p>2. upmodding someone's vote/comment automatically adds a vote from you for the same choice<p>We need to keep in mind that a benefit of polls is that the folks answering can answer without worrying about loosing karma if they vote for the least popular choice.
